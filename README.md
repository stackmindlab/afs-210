## ðŸŽ§ Capstone Project: Media Player Simulator

A terminal-based media player simulator built **without third-party libraries**, using only Python and course-approved data structures.

### ðŸ”¹ Features:
- Add/remove songs to a playlist  
- Play, skip, and go back between songs  
- Shuffle playlist using a custom (non-efficient) algorithm  
- Display current song and playlist order  
- Playlist preloaded with six sample songs  

### ðŸ”¹ Data Structures Used:
- **Linked List** â€“ core playlist navigation  
- **Stack** â€“ playback history (go back to previous song)  
- **Queue** â€“ next song simulation  
- **(Optional) Graph/Tree** â€“ advanced structure experimentation

> ðŸ’¡ This project reinforced how to apply data structures to simulate real-world systems like media players.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

- Strengthened core Python and algorithm skills through applied coding  
- Built reusable logic with object-oriented techniques  
- Practiced recursion, traversal, and real-world control flow  
- Gained confidence working with classic structures in practical projects

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps

- Convert the Media Player into a GUI using Python (Tkinter or PyQt)  
- Revisit Graph and Tree concepts in larger web-based apps  
- Continue exploring algorithm optimization with Python libraries
